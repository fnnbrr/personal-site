# fnnbrr's personal site

A simple site about me. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://react.dev), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS).

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository and run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies.

If using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the included [launch.json](./.vscode/launch.json) provides run commands with debugging support.

Or, using the command line:

- Run the development server
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Create a production build using [SSG (static site generation)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation)
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Preview the production build
  ```bash
  npx serve@latest out
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the development or production build.
